# Robots

![Banner](img/themes/v1/banner.png "Robots")

Robots is a school project made for my fird year at EPSI Nantes.
 It's my first Java project. The code is o  bject oriented, MVC and commented.
 It's a classic polluter/cleaner game, without user interraction. The main
 goal was to produce a fully functional game with different types of robots, a
 graphic view and the better code as possible for a beginner in Java. In this
 game, I made four different types of robots:

1. **JewelerMadman**: this one drops a jewel on the current cell and moves on the borders.

2. **JewelerJumper**: this one drops a jewel on the current cell and moves like a Chess rider.

3. **ThiefExpert**: this one steal the jewel he found on the cell and move on a random adjacent cell.

4. **ThiefDrunked**: because of alchool problems, this one forgets sometimes to steal the jewel.
